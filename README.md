# Kali-Linux-Hardening
This repository documents a Kali Linux system hardening project, with a focus on minimizing attack surface and validating security controls.

## Focus Areas

- Firewall configuration and network access control
- Intrusion prevention and brute-force protection
- Service minimization and attack surface reduction
- Bootloader and early-boot security hardening
- Authentication and privilege access hardening
- Filesystem and mount option security
- Kernel configuration and runtime hardening
- System integrity monitoring and rootkit detection
- Permission auditing and privilege misuse prevention

## Project Status

This repository is under active development.
Modules are added as individual hardening areas are implemented and validated.

## Approach

This project produces practical, hands-on system hardening. 
Each module documents changes that can be made to help minimize vulnerability to threat actors, the reasoning behind them, and standard verification steps to ensure controls are working as intended.

## Structure

- `modules` - Individual hardening modules with commands and rationale
- `README.md` - Project overview and scope

## Disclaimer

This project was created for educational and portfolio purposes.
Configurations should be reviewed and adjusted before use in production environments.
